📜 Contributing to Immutable

🚀 Thank you for your interest in contributing to Immutable!

Immutable is a censorship-resistant archive dedicated to preserving historical records, rediscovering lost knowledge, and ensuring that critical documents remain freely accessible to future generations. Using IBC, IPFS, Jackal, Sentinel DVPN, and Secret Network, we protect martyrs’ testimonies, prophecy fulfillment, historical research, and linguistic accuracy against distortion or censorship.

🔹 Do You Have Hidden or Rare Documents?

If you possess rare, suppressed, or undisclosed historical materials—including:
	•	🏛 Ancient manuscripts (forgotten or untranslated works)
	•	📜 Lost historical texts (persecution records, private archives)
	•	🔍 Suppressed books & writings (restricted research, banned histories)
	•	🏴 Personal or secret archives (private collections, documents that need to be preserved)

🚀 You are invited to share them with us for preservation! Immutable ensures decentralized, censorship-resistant storage, guaranteeing that history cannot be erased.

📜 Please [See the README](README.md) for an overview of the project and key historical references.

📦 How to Upload Your File to IPFS Using Storacha

Before submitting your document to Immutable, please upload it to IPFS. This ensures your contribution is decentralized, censorship-resistant, and stored immutably.

🔹 We recommend using Storacha Console — a fast and simple tool for IPFS uploads.

✅ Steps to Upload Using Storacha:

	1.	Visit the Upload Console
Go to: https://console.storacha.network

	2.	Enter Any Email Address
	•	No wallet needed.
	•	You may use a private or alias email for privacy — it’s only used to generate access.
 
	3.	Create an Upload Folder (or “Space”)
	•	This is called a Repo Name on Storacha.
	•	It organizes your files and becomes part of your IPFS path.
	•	Example folders: translations, suppressed-books, prophecy, church-history
 
	4.	Upload Your File
	•	Click Upload
	•	Select your document (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
	•	Place it inside the folder/space you created
 
	5.	Copy Your IPFS Link
	•	Once uploaded, you’ll receive a link like:

[https://bafybe...<hash>.ipfs.w3s.link/translations/your-file.pdf](https://bafybeifybhwroffbk4zemaodqow63ovgg4wpcx26kqjldnkrgwnxzqvgfe.ipfs.w3s.link/History-Of-The-Christian-Church-03.pdf)


	•	Test the link in your browser to confirm it works.
