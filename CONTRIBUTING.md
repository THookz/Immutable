📜 Contributing to Immutable

🚀 Thank you for your interest in contributing to Immutable!

Immutable is a censorship-resistant archive dedicated to preserving historical records, rediscovering lost knowledge, and ensuring that critical documents remain freely accessible to future generations. Using IBC, IPFS, Jackal, Sentinel DVPN, and Secret Network, we protect martyrs’ testimonies, prophecy fulfillment, historical research, and linguistic accuracy against distortion or censorship.

🔹 Do You Have Hidden or Rare Documents?

If you possess rare, suppressed, or undisclosed historical materials—including:
	•	🏛 Ancient manuscripts (forgotten or untranslated works)
	•	📜 Lost historical texts (persecution records, private archives)
	•	🔍 Suppressed books & writings (restricted research, banned histories)
	•	🏴 Personal or secret archives (private collections, documents that need to be preserved)

🚀 You are invited to share them with us for preservation! Immutable ensures decentralized, censorship-resistant storage, guaranteeing that history cannot be erased.

📜 Please see the [README](README.md) for an overview of the project and key historical references.
