A powerful and deeply personal account of Clark Butterfield‚Äôs transformation from a Roman Catholic priest to a born-again Christian. Written shortly before his death, this book courageously explores the theological contradictions he discovered within Catholicism, his growing disillusionment with institutional religion, and his ultimate spiritual rebirth in Christ. Originally rejected by mainstream publishers due to its bold claims, Night Journey From Rome stands as a testimony of conviction, conscience, and divine calling. It is both a historical witness and a heartfelt appeal to those seeking freedom in Christ beyond manmade traditions.

In Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, historian Michael A. Hoffman II presents a chilling expos√© on the invisible influence of occult systems and esoteric rituals embedded within modern political, religious, and cultural institutions. Completed just months before the pivotal events of September 11, 2001, this prophetic work dissects how mass manipulation, trauma-based symbolism, and ritualized deception have been used to shape public consciousness and suppress spiritual awakening.

Hoffman argues that hidden elites‚Äîwhat he calls ‚Äúthe Cryptocracy‚Äù‚Äîemploy psychological operations not merely for control but to create spiritual confusion and apathy. The book draws from historical documents, esoteric traditions, and real-world examples to connect the dots between secret societies, religious institutions, state power, and mass media. 

Themes:
-Occult symbolism in mass culture
-Psychological manipulation & mind control
-Secret societies (e.g., Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism)
-The weaponization of media and ritual
-The suppression of spiritual and historical truth

Quote from the book:

	‚ÄúThe most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed."

This powerful expos√©, written by a former Catholic nun, lifts the veil on the secretive history and far-reaching influence of the Jesuit Order‚Äîoften referred to as ‚Äúthe Church‚Äôs most dangerous agents.‚Äù M.F. Cusack, once a devout insider, details the strategies, political intrigues, and religious subversions used by the Jesuits to manipulate global affairs and consolidate control across centuries. This rare firsthand account is not just a historical document‚Äîit‚Äôs a warning from within.

A must-read for those seeking to understand the hidden forces behind religious and geopolitical shifts throughout history.

Preserved as a single surviving copy in the Oxford Library, this rare 1650 treatise by James Ockford is a bold defense of the seventh-day Sabbath. Written during a time of great theological turbulence, Ockford challenges the growing institutional shift from Saturday to Sunday observance, arguing from Scripture, logic, and conscience that the seventh day‚Äînot the first‚Äîis the true Christian Sabbath.

His arguments systematically expose how tradition and political pressure ‚Äúdeformed‚Äù the Fourth Commandment, replacing divine law with man-made customs. With objections addressed and truth carefully restored, this forgotten work stands as a remarkable witness to the Sabbath reform movement long before its revival in later centuries.

Ockford‚Äôs words were nearly lost to time‚Äîbut now, through decentralized preservation, they can be rediscovered and studied by all.

Charles Chiniquy, a Catholic priest for five decades, offers this courageous and controversial testimony from inside the heart of Roman Catholicism. Exposing manipulation, political entanglements, and deep spiritual conflict, Chiniquy reveals how his conscience and study of the Scriptures ultimately led him to break away‚Äîat great personal cost.

A close friend of Abraham Lincoln, who once defended Chiniquy in court, the author draws connections between religious liberty, moral conviction, and the preservation of truth in the face of institutional power.

This work is a rare window into the lived experience of a priest-turned-reformer and remains one of the most compelling firsthand accounts of faith, freedom, and the courage to stand alone.
