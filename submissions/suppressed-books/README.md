 ðŸ“œ Why Decentralized Storage Matters

These books were banned, suppressed, or quietly erased from mainstream awarenessâ€”not because they were false, but because they were inconvenient. Through decentralized technologies like IPFS, Jackal, and IBC-integrated networks, we ensure these critical documents are not only preserved, but uncensorable, immutable, and globally accessibleâ€”free from the control of governments, corporations, or religious institutions. This is truth defense by design

A powerful and deeply personal account of Clark Butterfieldâ€™s transformation from a Roman Catholic priest to a born-again Christian. Written shortly before his death, this book courageously explores the theological contradictions he discovered within Catholicism, his growing disillusionment with institutional religion, and his ultimate spiritual rebirth in Christ. Originally rejected by mainstream publishers due to its bold claims, Night Journey From Rome stands as a testimony of conviction, conscience, and divine calling.
