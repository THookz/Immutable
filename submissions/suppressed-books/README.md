Written shortly before his death, this book courageously explores the theological contradictions he discovered within Catholicism, his growing disillusionment with institutional religion, and his ultimate spiritual rebirth in Christ.

In Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, historian Michael A. Hoffman II presents a chilling exposé on the invisible influence of occult systems and esoteric rituals embedded within modern political, religious, and cultural institutions. Completed just months before the pivotal events of September 11, 2001, this prophetic work dissects how mass manipulation, trauma-based symbolism, and ritualized deception have been used to shape public consciousness and suppress spiritual awakening.

Hoffman argues that hidden elites—what he calls “the Cryptocracy”—employ psychological operations not merely for control but to create spiritual confusion and apathy. The book draws from historical documents, esoteric traditions, and real-world examples to connect the dots between secret societies, religious institutions, state power, and mass media. 

Themes:
-Occult symbolism in mass culture
-Psychological manipulation & mind control
-Secret societies (e.g., Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism)
-The weaponization of media and ritual
-The suppression of spiritual and historical truth

Quote from the book:

	“The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed."

This powerful exposé, written by a former Catholic nun, lifts the veil on the secretive history and far-reaching influence of the Jesuit Order—often referred to as “the Church’s most dangerous agents.” M.F. Cusack, once a devout insider, details the strategies, political intrigues, and religious subversions used by the Jesuits to manipulate global affairs and consolidate control across centuries. This rare firsthand account is not just a historical document—it’s a warning from within.

A must-read for those seeking to understand the hidden forces behind religious and geopolitical shifts throughout history.

Preserved as a single surviving copy in the Oxford Library, this rare 1650 treatise by James Ockford is a bold defense of the seventh-day Sabbath. Written during a time of great theological turbulence, Ockford challenges the growing institutional shift from Saturday to Sunday observance, arguing from Scripture, logic, and conscience that the seventh day—not the first—is the true Christian Sabbath.

His arguments systematically expose how tradition and political pressure “deformed” the Fourth Commandment, replacing divine law with man-made customs. With objections addressed and truth carefully restored, this forgotten work stands as a remarkable witness to the Sabbath reform movement long before its revival in later centuries.

Ockford’s words were nearly lost to time—but now, through decentralized preservation, they can be rediscovered and studied by all.

Charles Chiniquy, a Catholic priest for five decades, offers this courageous and controversial testimony from inside the heart of Roman Catholicism. Exposing manipulation, political entanglements, and deep spiritual conflict, Chiniquy reveals how his conscience and study of the Scriptures ultimately led him to break away—at great personal cost.

A close friend of Abraham Lincoln, who once defended Chiniquy in court, the author draws connections between religious liberty, moral conviction, and the preservation of truth in the face of institutional power.

This work is a rare window into the lived experience of a priest-turned-reformer and remains one of the most compelling firsthand accounts of faith, freedom, and the courage to stand alone.

This detailed manual, based on survivor testimony, declassified CIA files, and research from inside intelligence and occult networks, lays out the disturbing blueprint for how trauma-based mind control has been used to fracture identity, suppress memory, and create programmable individuals—undetectable even under hypnosis.

The authors, one a former insider and the other a counselor to victims, connect government-sponsored programs like MK-Ultra with occult ritual abuse, showing how elite power structures engineered mind control systems for espionage, entertainment, and spiritual warfare.

Much of this content—once dismissed as “conspiracy”—has since been validated by FOIA-released government documents and survivor litigation. This book offers one of the most comprehensive and chilling explanations of how technology, psychology, and spirituality have been weaponized to enslave the human soul.

Topics Include:
	•	MK-Ultra, Monarch programming, and trauma-induced dissociation
	•	Spiritual layering & demonic programming through ritual abuse
	•	Programming triggers embedded in media and entertainment
	•	The use of Jesuit, occult, and Nazi psychological models
	•	Firsthand accounts of handlers, split personalities, and recovery

Censored for decades, this book continues to be blacklisted and shadow-banned due to its extensive footnotes, specificity, and documentation

The Deadly Deception is the gripping personal testimony of Jim Shaw, a former 33rd-degree Freemason and active participant in elite Masonic ceremonies, who came to believe that the core teachings of Freemasonry directly contradict the Gospel of Jesus Christ. With rare access to inner rituals and oaths, Shaw exposes the theological compromises and Babylonian esotericism embedded in high-level Masonic rites.

Notably, Shaw became one of the only insiders to document his departure from Freemasonry and its spiritual implications, confirming long-held concerns by early Protestant reformers and Christian theologians regarding syncretism, secrecy, and allegiance to hidden masters.

This book includes:
	•	The hidden meaning of the 33rd degree initiation
	•	Oaths that contradict Scripture and require secrecy above truth
	•	Why biblical Christians cannot reconcile Freemasonry with Christ
	•	Symbols tracing back to the mystery religions of Egypt and Babylon
	•	How Freemasonry influences law, church leadership, and politics

Proven true by independent documentation, ritual texts, and confirmations from other ex-Masons, this book remains a cornerstone work in understanding the spiritual deception cloaked in fraternal language.

Author: David I. Kertzer

Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David I. Kertzer delves into the complex relationship between Pope Pius XI and Benito Mussolini in this groundbreaking work. Drawing from newly opened Vatican archives and Fascist records, Kertzer reveals how the Vatican and the Fascist regime collaborated to consolidate power in Italy. The book uncovers the mutual interests that led to the Lateran Accords of 1929, granting the Church significant privileges while legitimizing Mussolini’s dictatorship. Kertzer also examines the Pope’s growing disillusionment with Fascism, particularly concerning anti-Semitic laws, and his attempts to distance the Church from Mussolini’s policies before his death in 1939. ￼￼

Author: Burke McCarty

Burke McCarty presents a controversial perspective on the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, suggesting a broader conspiracy involving high-ranking officials and foreign influences. The book posits that Lincoln’s death was not solely the act of John Wilkes Booth but part of a larger plot to undermine the Union and its leadership. McCarty’s narrative challenges mainstream historical accounts, offering an alternative viewpoint that encourages readers to re-examine the events surrounding one of America’s most pivotal moments.

The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians
Author: Rev. I. B. Pranaitis (1892)
This rare and controversial 19th-century document—written by Russian Catholic priest Rev. I. B. Pranaitis—attempts to examine passages from the Talmud that allegedly speak critically of Christians and Jesus Christ. Published in 1892, the work sparked decades of theological and cultural debate, particularly within Eastern Orthodox and Catholic circles.

While often cited in polemical discussions, The Talmud Unmasked has also been criticized for selective interpretation and lack of rabbinic authority. However, its historical relevance remains notable as a snapshot of interreligious tension during the Russian Empire’s era of religious censorship. For scholars studying early religious apologetics, censorship, and sociopolitical religious narratives, this text offers significant insight into the religious polemics of its time.

[The Vatican Assassins](https://bafybeidzytuofuqfmswrdskexb7dkelzxpvi7dgobw5vt4s4nvjxwdc7fa.ipfs.w3s.link/Vatican_assassins_by_Eric_John_Phelps%202.pdf)

Vatican Assassins: Wounded in the House of My Friends
Author: Eric Jon Phelps
Eric Jon Phelps’ Vatican Assassins is a voluminous and highly detailed account alleging the far-reaching influence of the Jesuit Order in global politics, war, economics, and religious movements. Framed through a Protestant historical lens, this book connects the Jesuit Order to major world events—from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln to the shaping of geopolitical strategy across centuries.

Rooted in hundreds of citations, declassified documents, and first-person testimonies, Phelps’ work challenges readers to consider the role of religious power structures in shaping historical and present-day systems of control. It’s a modern echo of Reformation-era critiques of papal power—particularly focused on the notion that the Jesuits operate as an elite intelligence wing of the Vatican.

This book stands as a synthesis of counter-historical theory and Protestant conspiracy scholarship. It is intended for critical thinkers seeking to explore alternate interpretations of Church history, geopolitics, and the untold power dynamics behind major world shifts.
